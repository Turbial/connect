# Connect — Phase 8 Scope Plan: Performance & Vertical Depth (Days 61-90)

Derived from `STANDALONE_PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md` §26 Phase 3. Depends on
`PHASE_6_SCOPE.md` and `PHASE_7_SCOPE.md` shipping first — this phase moves
from "the work gets done" to "the work is proven to perform," per the doc's
own Phase 3 goal.

## Goal (per the doc)

Connect proves not only that work was done, but that visibility improved
and the right decisions were surfaced (doc §26 Phase 3 success metric).

---

## 8.1 A/B Creative Testing Before Boost

**Doc reference:** §17, §26 Phase 3 item 1.

**Why first:** the doc calls this "one of the highest-leverage standalone
upgrades," and the boost policy engine (8.2) is more defensible once boosts
are backed by a tested winner rather than a single untested variant.

**Current state:** `src/content-engine/generate.ts` generates a single
caption/creative per content item; `src/approval/boost.ts` proposes a boost
on that single post's performance.

**Scope:**
- Generate two caption variants (and, where the platform/budget allows, two
  creative variants) for posts flagged as boost candidates — not for every
  post, to avoid doubling generation cost across the whole calendar.
- Where organic split-testing is feasible (e.g. staggered posting),
  measure both variants' engagement before proposing a boost; where it
  isn't, fall back to today's single-variant flow rather than inventing a
  synthetic comparison.
- Boost proposal copy includes the comparison per the doc's example: "We
  tested two versions. Version B got 42% more engagement. Want to boost it
  for $25?" — only shown when a real comparison exists; never fabricated
  when only one variant ran.

**Exit criteria:** at least one platform's boost proposals can cite a real
A/B comparison; posts that didn't get a real test never claim one in their
proposal copy.

## 8.2 Boost Policy Engine

**Doc reference:** §18, §26 Phase 3 item 2.

**Why second:** extends the existing hard 5x clamp (`clampBudget` in
`src/approval/boost.ts`) with graded autonomy — needs 8.1 in place first so
auto-boost thresholds have a meaningful performance signal to key off of.

**Current state:** every boost requires an explicit owner SMS/WhatsApp
approval; `clampBudget` only enforces an upper bound on a requested amount.

**Scope:**
- Per-business policy fields on `BusinessProfile` (Phase 6.2): max weekly
  spend, max daily spend, max boost per post, auto-boost threshold, manual
  approval threshold, allowed platforms, stop-loss condition, budget reset
  schedule — the doc's exact field list in §18.
- `handleBoostReply`'s flow gains an auto-boost path: if a post beats the
  business's configured performance threshold AND the proposed amount is
  under the business's `auto-boost threshold` AND weekly spend is under the
  weekly cap, launch without an approval round-trip; otherwise behave
  exactly as today (approval required).
- The existing 5x hard safety cap (`clampBudget`) remains the absolute
  ceiling regardless of policy configuration — policy can be stricter than
  the hard cap, never looser.

**Exit criteria:** a business with no policy configured behaves identically
to today (always asks); a business with auto-boost configured gets
spend launched within its own stated limits, never exceeding the existing
hard cap.

## 8.3 Vertical-Specific Score Weights (Restaurant + Wellness)

**Doc reference:** §9.2, §9.3, §26 Phase 3 item 3.

**Why third:** Phase 6.3 shipped only the home-services weight table by the
doc's own sequencing (§9.1, "probably the best first vertical"); this item
is explicitly the deferred follow-up — tuning restaurant and wellness
weights now that the `vertical` field and weight-table shape already exist.

**Scope:**
- Fill in the `restaurant` and `wellness` entries in
  `src/visibility-score/weights.ts` (stubbed in Phase 6.3) using the doc's
  §4/§9.2/§9.3 weight guidance (reviews/sentiment and GBP/Yelp/OpenTable
  high for restaurants; Instagram/TikTok and trust signals high for
  wellness).
- Vertical-specific audit report copy (Phase 6.3 shipped this for home
  services only) extended to these two verticals.

**Exit criteria:** all three named verticals (home services, restaurant,
wellness) produce genuinely different score weightings and report copy;
`general` remains the unweighted fallback.

---

## 8.4 Vertical-Specific Platform Priority Map

**Doc reference:** §12, §26 Phase 3 item 4.

**Why fourth:** directly follows 8.3 — once a business has a vertical, the
doc says platform expansion work (moving platforms out of `stub`) should be
prioritized by that vertical's named platform list, not engineering
convenience.

**Scope:**
- A static map (`src/lib/verticalPlatformPriority.ts`): vertical → ordered
  platform list, taken directly from doc §12 (home services: GBP Local
  Posts, Nextdoor, Angi, Thumbtack, Yelp, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube
  Shorts, Bing Places; restaurant: GBP, Yelp, OpenTable, TripAdvisor,
  Instagram, TikTok, Facebook; wellness: Instagram, TikTok, GBP, Yelp,
  Facebook, YouTube Shorts).
- This is a **planning artifact**, not new adapter code — it informs which
  `stub`/`sandbox` platforms get prioritized for verification work, doc
  §12's "do not chase logos."

**Exit criteria:** any future platform-verification work can point to this
map to justify why a given platform was prioritized for a given vertical,
instead of an ad hoc choice.

---

## 8.5 Paid Boost Performance Report

**Doc reference:** §26 Phase 3 item 5. Builds on existing Phase 3 (original
program) outcome-attribution work (UTM tagging, call/form tracking).

**Scope:**
- Extend the weekly digest (Phase 6.5) with a boost-specific section:
  amount spent, attributed engagement/clicks (via existing UTM tagging),
  and — only where a real attribution path exists (call tracking, form
  tracking, CRM/booking event) — attributed leads/revenue. Sections with no
  attribution path are omitted, not estimated.

**Exit criteria:** a business with a wired attribution path sees real
lead/revenue numbers tied to a specific boost; a business without one sees
spend/engagement only, never a fabricated lead estimate.

---

## 8.6 Multi-Location Data Model

**Doc reference:** §10, §26 Phase 3 item 6.

**Why this far down:** the doc places this in Phase 3, after the
single-business owner experience (Phase 6/7) is real — same reasoning the
original Phase 4 program already applied to Phase 2. This item is the data
model only; the full agency console and franchise permission hierarchy
(doc §10, §11) are Phase 9+ candidates, not in scope here.

**Scope:**
- Introduce `organization` above `business` (as already planned in the
  original program's Phase 4.1) with `business` becoming a `location` row
  under an org — existing single-location businesses become orgs of one,
  no special-casing.
- Location-level visibility scores roll up to an org-level view (read path
  only this phase) — brand templates, corporate/local permission
  enforcement, and bulk operations remain out of scope until a real
  multi-location customer exists to validate against.

**Exit criteria:** an org with N locations can see each location's score
and an aggregate, with zero behavior change for existing single-location
orgs.

---

## 8.7 Agency White-Label Report v1

**Doc reference:** §11, §26 Phase 3 item 7.

**Why here:** the doc's cheapest growth lever, but deliberately scoped down
to *report* white-labeling only — full agency console (multi-client
console, client billing, bulk approval) is explicitly a later doc item
(§11's fuller list), not this phase's.

**Scope:**
- The weekly email digest (Phase 6.5) and chat score card (Phase 7.2)
  already resolve `orgDisplayName`/white-label name — extend this to also
  swap the SMS/WhatsApp sender identity per org, so an agency's clients see
  the agency's brand end-to-end, not just in the email subject line.

**Exit criteria:** an agency-managed business's entire approval/report
surface (SMS sender name, email branding, chat replies) shows the agency's
brand, not "MightyMax," with zero config needed for non-agency businesses.

---

## 8.8 Missed-Call and Customer-Message Lead Routing

**Doc reference:** §16 (CRM/PM bridge, scoped down), §26 Phase 3 item 8.

**Why scoped down:** the doc explicitly warns Connect "should not become a
full CRM/PM tool" (§16) — this phase implements only the *detection and
routing* half of §16, not CRM/PM creation itself, since no CRM/PM system is
integrated yet and inventing one would violate the truth-telling principle
this whole program is built on.

**Current state:** `src/lib/missedCallTextback.ts` and
`src/lib/customerMessaging.ts` already detect missed calls and log inbound
messages.

**Scope:**
- Classify inbound customer messages/missed-call follow-ups into a fixed
  set of intents (`lead_intent`, `question`, `complaint`, `other`) using
  the same kind of bounded classification as Phase 7.3's edit-reply
  categories — not open-ended.
- `lead_intent` messages get flagged in the weekly digest (8.5) and, if the
  owner's profile has an external CRM webhook URL configured (new optional
  `BusinessProfile` field), POSTed there — Connect routes the signal; it
  does not store or manage the lead itself.

**Exit criteria:** a lead-intent message is visible to the owner within the
existing reporting/approval surfaces, and optionally forwarded to an
external system if configured; Connect holds no CRM state of its own.

---

## 8.9 Agent Action Queue v1

**Doc reference:** §15 (architecture), §26 Phase 3 item 9.

**Why ninth:** prerequisite for 8.10's router — the doc's future model
(`event/schedule → intent router → tools → action queue → policy check →
execute or approve → log → report`) needs the queue to exist before a
router can write to it.

**Scope:**
- An `agent_action` table matching the doc's exact record shape: source,
  intent, tool, input, output, status, risk level, approval required, owner
  response, platform result, error, retry count, audit log.
- Existing actions (content generation, posting, boost proposals) get
  logged into this table as a **parallel audit trail** this phase — the
  existing weekly-batch code path is not rewritten to depend on the queue
  yet, avoiding the doc's explicit warning ("the weekly cron loop is good,
  do not destroy it").

**Exit criteria:** every action the existing system already takes is
visible as a row in `agent_action` with full context, without changing how
or when those actions actually execute.

---

## 8.10 Tool-Calling Intent Router — Design + First Implementation

**Doc reference:** §15, §25 (build order rationale), §26 Phase 3 item 10.

**Why last:** the doc is explicit and repeated (§15, §25) that this is a
platform architecture move that follows once the core owner experience
(Phase 6/7) is strong — this is the single largest-risk item in the whole
90-day plan and is scoped as design + first implementation only, not a full
migration.

**Scope:**
- Register the doc's example tools (§15) as discrete callable functions
  with typed input/output, wrapping existing logic
  (`generate_content`→`content-engine/generate.ts`,
  `post_to_platform`→`distribution/index.ts`, `propose_boost`/`launch_boost`
  →`approval/boost.ts`, `run_visibility_audit`→the audit modules) — wrapping,
  not rewriting, so existing tested behavior is preserved.
- One real trigger path routed through the router end-to-end as a proof of
  concept (e.g. the 7.2 chat-intent classifier's `show_score`/`whats_next`
  becomes router-dispatched instead of a bespoke branch) — not the full
  weekly batch, which stays on its existing direct code path per 8.9's
  scope note.
- Policy-check step reuses 8.2's boost policy engine as its first real
  policy gate, rather than inventing a separate policy model.

**Exit criteria:** at least one real owner-facing flow is dispatched
through the router/tool-registry/action-queue path instead of a direct
function call, with the weekly batch loop completely unaffected and still
running on its proven direct path.

---

## Explicitly out of scope for Phase 8

Full agency console (multi-client console, client billing, bulk approval —
beyond report white-labeling), franchise permission hierarchy and brand
governance (beyond the location data model), CRM/PM system ownership,
full Tool-Calling Router migration of the weekly batch, performance
flywheel, partner-facing API. All are real, later items (doc §10/§11 full
scope, §26 Months 7-12) gated on Phase 8 proving out at smaller scale first.

## Build order

8.1 → 8.2 → 8.3 → 8.4 → 8.5, then 8.6/8.7/8.8 in any order (independent of
each other and of 8.1-8.5), then 8.9 → 8.10 last, since the action queue and
router are the highest-risk items and benefit most from everything else
being stable first.
